# 🍽️ NutriSnap AI

**Eat Smart. Live Better.**
Your AI-powered nutritionist that helps you track your meals, understand their nutritional value, and make healthier food choices using just a photo.

---

## 📖 Overview

**NutriSnap AI** is a mobile-first application that allows users to snap a photo of their meal and instantly get detailed nutritional insights.
It uses **AI-based image recognition** to identify the foods on your plate, calculate both **macronutrients** (carbs, protein, fat) and **micronutrients** (vitamins, iron, sodium, calcium, etc.), and even suggest personalized alternatives for users with dietary restrictions like diabetes or hypertension.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Smart Food Recognition

Take a photo or upload an image of your meal — the AI automatically identifies what’s on your plate and provides accurate calorie and nutrient breakdowns.

### 🍎 Macronutrient & Micronutrient Tracking

View a detailed composition of your food, including macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

### 💬 Smart Swap

If a user has a health condition (like diabetes, PCOS, or hypertension), the app suggests healthier, localized food alternatives — not just warnings.

### 📈 Progress Timeline

Users can view their previously scanned meals as visual cards in a timeline view, helping track eating patterns over time.

### 🔐 Personalized Setup

Each user logs in with a unique ID and sets up their **height, weight, age, and gender**, allowing the app to calculate a daily calorie goal and track progress accordingly.
